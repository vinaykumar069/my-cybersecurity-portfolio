              I recently participated in my first Capture The Flag (CTF) competition, and it was an exhilarating experience. I decided to document my journey, the challenges I faced, and the things I learned along the way.
            </p>
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
              The CTF was a jeopardy-style competition with a variety of categories, including web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics. As a beginner, I decided to focus on the web exploitation challenges, as that's where I have the most (albeit limited) experience.
            </p>
            <h2>The Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              I managed to solve a few of the introductory web challenges. One of them involved a simple SQL injection vulnerability, while another required me to exploit a file inclusion vulnerability. These challenges were a great way to apply the theoretical knowledge I've gained from online courses and labs.
            </p>
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
              The most important lesson I learned is that CTFs are not just about technical skills. They're also about time management, problem-solving, and perseverance. I also learned the importance of taking good notes and having a systematic approach to tackling challenges.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Overall, my first CTF was a fantastic learning experience. I'm already looking forward to the next one!

          <h1 class="blog-post-title">Understanding Nmap</h1>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on <time datetime="2023-11-15">November 15, 2023</time></p>

              Nmap (Network Mapper) is one of the most fundamental tools in the arsenal of any security professional. It's a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. In this post, we'll take a look at some of the basic and advanced features of Nmap.
            </p>
            <h2>Basic Scans</h2>
            <p>
              The most basic Nmap scan is a simple TCP connect scan, which can be performed with the `-sT` flag. This scan is reliable, but it's also very noisy and easily detectable.
            </p>
            <pre><code>nmap -sT 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
            <h2>Stealth Scans</h2>
            <p>
              For more stealthy scanning, you can use a SYN scan (`-sS`), which is often referred to as a "half-open" scan. This type of scan is less likely to be logged by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
            </p>
            <pre><code>nmap -sS 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
            <h2>Version Detection</h2>
            <p>
              One of Nmap's most powerful features is its ability to determine the version of the services running on open ports. This can be done with the `-sV` flag.
            </p>
            <pre><code>nmap -sV 192.168.1.1</code></pre>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Nmap is a versatile and powerful tool with a vast array of options and features. This post has only scratched the surface of what Nmap is capable of. I encourage you to explore the official documentation and experiment with different scan types and options.
